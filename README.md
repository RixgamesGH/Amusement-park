# Amusement Park

This project is an interphase for a checkout system for amusement parks or similar places where ticket entry is required. \
I made this project for an assignment at school. The project is written entirely in Python and the frontend is done with the use of the pygame library.

#### Additional requirements
- Adobe Reader or Acrobat. Make sure you have this installed on your device's C drive.
- Microsoft Word


## Initial setup

The first time you start the file you'll be asked to enter a license code for PySimpleGUI. Simply copy the code from this [file](docs/PySimpleGUI-license).\
After that there will be some questions asked for the initial setup of the settings. It will ask for:
- The PIN to access the staff section
- The name of the park
- The prizes for each age category
- Group discount information

All the information, except for the park name,  needs to be exclusively numbers, with optionally decimals (for example: 9.99)
