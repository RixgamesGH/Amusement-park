# Amusement Park

This project is an interphase for a checkout system for amusement parks or similar places where ticket entry is required. I made this project for an assignment at school. The project is written entirely in Python and the frontend is done with the use of the pygame library.

## Features

- 4 supported languages
- Fullscreen mode
- Touchscreen support
- Generates tickets and prints them with default printer
- Option to print receipt as well
- Customizable park name en prizes
- PIN locked staff section


## Installation

The program requires you to have a version of Adobe Reader or Acrobat installed. Make sure you have this installed on your device's C drive.

After having done that, you can download the zip file found in [Releases](https://github.com/RixgamesGH/Amusement-park/releases). \
Then, unzip the file and make sure it's on the C drive. \
You now have a map with some files. You can run the program by starting the exe file.

## Initial setup

The first time you start the file you'll be asked to enter a license code for PySimpleGUI. Simply copy the code from this [file](docs/PySimpleGUI-license).\
After that there will be some questions asked for the initial setup of the settings. It will ask for: \
- The PIN to access the staff section
- The name of the park
- The prizes for each age category
- Group discount information

All the information, except for the park name,  needs to be exclusively numbers, with optionally decimals (for example: 9.99)
